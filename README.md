### One Sample Proportion Test

In a Pew Internet and American Life Project Survey, 755 randomly selected adults who use the Internet were asked if they have ever paid to access or download music. We will be using a one sample Z-test/Chi-Square Test of Independence to test whether the true porportion of all Internet using adults who have paid to access or download music exceeds .7. 

### Conditions Required for a Valid Large-Sample Hypothesis for p

2. The sample size is large (npo >= 15) and (nqo >= 15)
